# CHANGELOG

## v1.6.0 - 2019-03-12

Some internal refactoring to use our new scala-monitoring library.

## v1.5.0 - 2019-02-25

This release removes the need to pass an `s3Client` to `SQS.createHybridRecordWith`
and `SQS.createHybridRecordNotificationWith`.

## v1.4.0 - 2019-02-25

This release adds a `namespace` parameter to `SNSBuilder.buildSNSWriter`.

## v1.3.0 - 2019-02-22

This release adds a new class, `NotificationStream[T]`, which does the work of
wrapping an `SQSStream[NotificationMessage]`, reading those messages from the
queue and unpacking them as instances of the case class `T` â€“ hiding the mucky
JSON decoding from the worker services, which just get handed lovely case classes.

## v1.2.0 - 2019-02-08

This release adds the `messaging_typesafe` library for configuring the `messaging` library using Typesafe.

## v1.1.2 - 2019-02-06

Start using the scala-fixtures lib rather than vendoring fixtures.

## v1.1.1 - 2019-02-06
